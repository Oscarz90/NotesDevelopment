A linked list consists of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains two things: the actual data being stored (which can be basically any type of data) and a pointer (or link) to the next node in the sequence. There are also doubly linked lists where each node has a pointer to both the next item and the previous item in the list.

**Properties**

| Property | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| head | The first element inserted in the list |
| tail | The last element inserted in the list |
| size | The number of elements in the list |

**Main operations**

| Operation | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
|add | Add a new node in the list |
|addAt | Add a new node in the list but in the position given by an index |
|remove | Remove a node for the given data |
